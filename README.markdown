# Try bliss

Game to learn bliss symbols language. Are you developer?  Learner? Teacher or expert, learn about bliss symbols. It's a symbolic cognitive language. You can improve your own thoughts formulation while trying to discover and learn about. Are you a designer? Art passionated? These icons are so inspirable. I'm using the official images from and authorized by "Blisssymbolics Communication International(BCI)":http://www.blissymbolics.org/.

The language as it own has your own way. For me writing in english (my second language) is so more easy to express in simple and clear way than to express myself in my native language (Portuguese from Brazil).

The communication is the act where the listener understood the speaker. Bliss symbolics can be a great tool to keep us doing communication with less restrictions as possible. It can be so much more easy than written languages and keeping it's own global sense around an specific knowledge.

I think it can be a bridge to improve our brain and optimize the thinking proccess every time. Try something different, learn bliss today!
